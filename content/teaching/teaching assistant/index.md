      title: "My Approach to Teaching"
      text: |-
        My teaching philosophy is grounded in adaptability, intentional design, and care. I view each classroom as a dynamic space shaped by the diverse experiences, identities, and commitments students bring with them—including those navigating higher education as first-generation college students, working professionals, or members of historically excluded communities.

        I design my courses using a backward planning framework, centering clarity and accessibility from the outset. I prioritize well-structured materials, transparent learning outcomes, and assessments that offer flexibility and choice. Whether through asynchronous modules or “choose-your-own-adventure” assignments, my goal is to support different modes of engagement while maintaining academic rigor.

        I believe that fostering student agency is essential not only for learning but also for integrity. In an era where artificial intelligence and generative tools are reshaping how students interact with knowledge, I encourage critical reflection and collaborative inquiry over surveillance. When students feel trusted and supported, they respond with curiosity and accountability.
