        ### Published Papers

        **The effects of gender stereotypes on citizens‚Äô perceptions of corruption**  
        _Handbook on Gender and Corruption in Democracies (2024)_  
        [Read it here](https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollchap/book/9781803923246/book-part-9781803923246-31.xml?tab_body=abstract-copy1)

        <p>
        Do gender stereotypes influence citizens‚Äô perceptions of government corruption? Gender stereotypes of female politicians generally cast an image of higher ethical behavior compared to male counterparts. Using a conjoint experiment in Malaysia (N = 2000), I find that men are perceived as significantly more likely to engage in corruption than women, particularly by male respondents.

        ### Working Papers

        **Natural Disasters and the Electability of Women: Evidence from Philippine Mayoral Elections**  
        _Working Paper (2024)_

        <p>
        Do natural disasters influence electoral outcomes, and does this effect vary by candidate gender? I argue that natural disasters intensify gendered voting biases. Using panel data from 1,632 municipalities and typhoon exposure data, I find disasters reduce win rates for female challengers and erode vote shares for female incumbents under repeated shocks.

        ### Other Publications

        **Breaking barriers or reinforcing bias? Climate crises and the gender divide in political leadership**  
        _Kleinman Center Blog (2024)_  
        [Read it here](https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/commentary/blog/insights-from-the-the-political-economy-of-climate-change-and-the-environment-2024-mini-conference/)

        <p>
        This commentary explores whether climate-induced crises open leadership opportunities for women or reinforce masculine-coded leadership norms. It argues that disaster politics can reproduce the very inequalities they seem to disrupt.

      title: "My Approach to Teaching"
      text: |-
        My teaching philosophy is grounded in adaptability, intentional design, and care. I view each classroom as a dynamic space shaped by the diverse experiences, identities, and commitments students bring with them‚Äîincluding those navigating higher education as first-generation college students, working professionals, or members of historically excluded communities.

        I design my courses using a backward planning framework, centering clarity and accessibility from the outset. I prioritize well-structured materials, transparent learning outcomes, and assessments that offer flexibility and choice. Whether through asynchronous modules or ‚Äúchoose-your-own-adventure‚Äù assignments, my goal is to support different modes of engagement while maintaining academic rigor.

        I believe that fostering student agency is essential not only for learning but also for integrity. In an era where artificial intelligence and generative tools are reshaping how students interact with knowledge, I encourage critical reflection and collaborative inquiry over surveillance. When students feel trusted and supported, they respond with curiosity and accountability.
